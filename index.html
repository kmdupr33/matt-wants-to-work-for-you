        <p>
          "Philosopher" literally means "lover of knowledge," and although I'm no longer pursuing a career in philosophy, I haven't lost my passion for learning and sharing knowledge with others, a passion that you say is important for your team members at <span class="brand">abe</span>. Check out my O'Reilly book on RxJava or <span class="brand">ask Scott Crespo</span> about the presentation I gave on testing in go for evidence of my passion for gaining and sharing knowledge.

          <h3>Projects @ Walt Disney</h3>
          <p>
            We had trouble keeping track of all the different devices we experimented with on our team, so, using <span class="brand">go</span>, angular 2, and couchbasedb, I worked on software that made it easy to check devices in and out using a mobile app that scanned QR codes attached to company mobile devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also developed software to automate project assignments using <span class="brand">ruby</span> and for tracking projects and generating progress reports using <span class="brand">go</span>, angular 2, and couchbasedb

          <p>
            A project for Hack the Arena, a hackathon that <span class="brand">Orett Davis</span> put on. I <span class="brand">co-led the winning team</span> to build an application that allowed sports fans to play games on the jumbotron using their mobile devices. I briefly worked on the mobile clients and on load testing <span class="brand">the socket.io node server</span> using a small load testing program I wrote in <span class="brand">go</span>. Our software was successfully deployed at a Solar Bears game and was ready to handle all 10,000 fans in the stadium.

          While at Disney, I got a taste of working with microservices and machine-learning while <span class="brand">I developed a strategy for testing microservices for a NLP-based guest services application</span>. Working on this project whet my appetite for spending more time exploring microservice- and machine-learning-based applications.

          I also spent some time at disney "dockerizing" our web applications. <span class="brand">Docker</span>, as you know, can be very useful for deploying microservices.

          I love thinking about software architecture. I recently realized that I care far more about scalable architectures than fancy UI or UX. See <a href="http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/why-we-should-stop-putting-logic-in-activities/">my writing on Android application architecture</a>, for example.
