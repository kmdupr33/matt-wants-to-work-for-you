        <h2>I love building the best Android apps possible</h2>
        <p>
          I've spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to build Android apps. I've written an O'Reilly book about how to leverage RxJava to write better apps, and I have several articles that have been featured in Android Weekly, a weekly collection of the best articles on Android development. You can read my most recently featured article <a href="http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/an-espresso-test-recorder-deep-dive/">here</a>.

          <h3>Hotswitch</h3>
          <p>
            I built most of <a href="http://www.hotswitch.com/">Hotswitch</a>, a social tv app from the ground up. I'm most proud of the efficient and memory-leak-proof data loading code I wrote, a solution that partially inspired the creation of <a href="http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/post/rxloader-boilerplate-free-data-loading-with-loaders-and-rxjava/">RxLoader</a>, an open source library for elegantly loading data in Android applicaitons. I'm also proud of the way I was able to leverage RxJava to elegantly handle complicated asynchronous events.

          <h3>GotChosen</h3>
          <p>
            My main accomplishments at GotChosen, a social media company, were a) architecting and partially implementing a list view based on Facebook's newsfeed list view that was <span class="brand">more performant than the stock list view</span> that comes with the Android SDK and b) setting up a CI server for our Android builds.

            I developed (mostly) Android and (some) iOS applications for various clients at Echo Interaction Group. I worked on setting up a CI server for Android builds here as well.

              Most recently, I worked on the Emerging Technologies team, a team where we explored new technologies that we wanted to integrate into the Disney Experience App. Most of my work was on iOS applications, but I did have a small Android project.

          You're looking for a "self-starter." I went from a wannabe philosophy professor to software engineer in just a few months, all by teaching myself to code mobile apps.
        </p>
        <p class="copy">
          You're looking for a "critical thinker." I have a master's degree in philosophy. Most philosophers tend to pride themselves in their ability to think critically and carefully. I'm no different.

          You're looking for someone who can "wear many hats." If you take a closer look at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/k-matthew-dupree-44672178">my resume</a>, you'll see that I've worked with a lot of technologies aside from Android, and if you get to know me, you'll see that I have an insatiable desire to learn and try new things.
